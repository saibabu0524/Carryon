# Carryon Android App

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the Carryon Android application, including its architecture, features, and setup instructions.

## Project Overview

Carryon is a modularized Android application designed to help users create and manage resumes. The app is built using modern Android development practices, including Kotlin, Jetpack Compose, and a multi-module architecture. This structure enhances maintainability, scalability, and separation of concerns.

### Modules

The project is divided into the following modules:

-   **`app`**: The main application module that integrates all other modules and provides the entry point to the app. It is responsible for the main `Activity` and the overall application class.

-   **`core`**: This module contains shared code and utilities that are used across different feature modules. It is further divided into:
    -   **`common`**: Includes common utilities and helper classes that can be reused throughout the application.
    -   **`database`**: Manages the local data persistence using Room. It defines the database, DAOs (Data Access Objects), and entities.
    -   **`datastore`**: Utilizes Jetpack DataStore for storing simple key-value data, such as user preferences and authentication tokens.
    -   **`network`**: Handles the networking layer of the app. It is built with Retrofit for making API calls and includes a `MockInterceptor` for testing with mock data.
    -   **`ui`**: A collection of shared Jetpack Compose UI components, themes, and styles that ensure a consistent look and feel across the app.

-   **`feature`**: This module contains the different feature modules of the app, each responsible for a specific functionality:
    -   **`auth`**: Manages user authentication, including sign-up, login, and password management screens. It has its own `ViewModel`s and navigation graph.
    -   **`main`**: The main feature module that the user interacts with after authentication. It includes the home screen, resume management, and user profile.

-   **`network`**: A separate module for network-related tasks. This seems to be a redundancy, as there is also a `core:network` module. This should be consolidated into a single networking module to avoid confusion and code duplication.

## Implemented Features

### `feature:auth`

-   **User Authentication**: The `auth` module provides a complete authentication flow, including:
    -   **Sign-up and Login**: Users can create a new account or log in with their email and password.
    -   **Input Validation**: The sign-up and login forms include robust input validation for all fields, such as email format, password length, and password confirmation.
    -   **Session Management**: User sessions are managed using Jetpack DataStore, which securely stores access and refresh tokens.
    -   **Dashboard**: A welcoming dashboard with a horizontal pager introduces the app's features to new users.
    -   **Architecture**: The module follows a clean architecture with `ViewModel`s for business logic, `UseCase`s for validation, and composable screens for the UI.
    -   **Password Management**: Complete integration of forgot password, reset password, and change password flows.
    -   **Social Login**: Google OAuth login integration is fully implemented.
    -   **Token Management**: Refresh token functionality and logout with proper token cleanup.

### `feature:main`

-   **Home Screen**: The `main` module features a dynamic home screen that:
    -   Welcomes the user by name.
    -   Displays recent activity, such as recently edited resumes.
    -   Includes shimmer effects for a smooth loading experience.
    -   Features a "Pro Tip" card with random advice for improving resumes.
    -   Provides quick access to create a new resume or browse templates.
-   **Resume and Template Management**: This feature allows users to:
    -   View a list of available resume templates.
    -   Filter templates by category.
    -   The app fetches templates from a remote source and caches them locally in the Room database for offline access.
-   **Profile Screen**: The profile screen offers:
    -   A summary of the user's information.
    -   Options to manage account settings.
    -   The ability to switch between light and dark themes, with the selected theme persisted in DataStore.
    -   Complete logout functionality with token cleanup.
-   **PDF Viewing**: The app integrates a PDF viewer to display resumes, although the PDF generation logic is still in progress.

  - `AuthRepositoryImpl` with proper implementation for all endpoints
  - Proper handling of `SuccessResponse` wrapper for certain endpoints like Google login

- **ViewModel Layer**:
  - `AuthenticationViewModel`: Handles logout, password management (forgot, reset, change), and Google login
  - `ProfileDetailsViewModel`: Handles profile details fetching
  - `ForgotPasswordViewModel`: Manages forgot password flow
  - `ResetPasswordViewModel`: Manages reset password flow
  - `ChangePasswordViewModel`: Manages change password flow
  - Updated `AccountViewModel` with proper logout functionality

- **Data Layer**:
  - All endpoints properly integrated with Retrofit API services
  - Proper error handling and state management (Loading, Success, Error)
  - Session management with secure token storage and cleanup

#### **Error Handling & State Management**
- All API calls follow `ApiResponse<T>` pattern with proper loading, success and error states
- Proper token management with DataStore integration
- Error messages are properly propagated to UI layer
- Loading states are displayed during network operations

#### **Security Considerations**
- Access and refresh tokens are securely stored in DataStore
- Proper token cleanup on logout
- Secure session management

## Features in Progress

-   **Resume Creation and Editing**: The UI for creating and editing resumes is partially implemented with a tabbed layout for different sections (Personal Info, Experience, Education, Skills). The `ResumeFormViewModel` is set up to handle the form state, but the logic for saving the data to the database is not yet complete.
-   **Backend Integration**: While the networking layer is set up with Retrofit, the integration with the backend for features like profile updates and resume syncing is still ongoing.

## Architecture Overview

### **Layered Architecture**
The application follows a clean architecture pattern with clear separation of concerns:
